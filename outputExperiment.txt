the ibm dsd technical information center - a total systems approach combining traditional library features and mechanized computer processing h. s. white the ibm data systems division technical information center (tic) provides an operating developmental system for integrated and compatible mechanized processing of technical information received within the organization. the system offers several advantages : 1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination and retrieval; 2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized records produced under a standard processing format within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue notices; 3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine processing would not cause gaps in the library's manual records; 4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations of its own program efficiency; 5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access and immediate microfilm access to its documents; 6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401 data processing system for all its processing and tostringoutput. since the system has been operating for over a year, the conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .
