    the ibm data systems division technical
     information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
    system for integrated and compatible mechanized
     processing of technical information received within the organization.
      the system offers several advantages :
         1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
    and retrieval;
         2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
      records produced under a standard processing format
      within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
      as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
    notices;
         3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
    processing would not cause gaps in the library's
      manual records;
         4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
    of its own program efficiency;
         5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
    and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
         6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
      data processing system for all its processing and toStringOutput.

      since the system has been operating for over a year, the
    conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .
